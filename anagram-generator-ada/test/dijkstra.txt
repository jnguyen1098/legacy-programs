Can you research something that is not science? I feel that the effort to use machines to try to mimic human 
reasoning is both foolish and dangerous. It is foolish because if you look at human reasoning as is, it is 
pretty lousy; even the most trained mathematicians are amateur thinkers. Instead of trying to imitate what we 
are good at, I think it is much more fascinating to investigate what we are poor at. It is foolish to use 
machines to imitate human beings, while machines are very good at being machines, and that is precisely 
something that human beings are very poor at. Any successful AI project by its very nature would castrate 
the machine. 1985.
